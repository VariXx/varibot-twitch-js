VariBot is a twitch chat bot with some custom features that were missing from existing bots. Some features include:
- Updating google spreadsheet of games completed on stream with current game's name and timestamp.
- Choose random game from google spreadsheet.
- Playing sounds for channel points (pubsub) rewards. 
- Choosing a random GTA radio station.
- Listing the GTA timelines based on the game currently being played.
- Automatic !multi command when "!multi" and "@\<useranme\>" are in stream title.

This project was started to learn node. It may eventually be public. If you're reading this it's probably already public and I forgot to update the readme. Please open an issue for that.
