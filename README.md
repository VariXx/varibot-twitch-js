VariBot is a twitch chat bot with some custom features that were missing from existing bots. Some features include:
- Updating google spreadsheet of games completed on stream with current game's name and timestamp.
- Playing sounds for channel points (pubsub) rewards. 
- Choosing a random GTA radio station.
- Listing the GTA timelines based on the game currently being played.

This project was started to learn node. It may eventually be public. If you're reading this it's probably already public and I forgot to update the readme. Please open an issue for that.
